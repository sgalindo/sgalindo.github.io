                      Modified Procedural Worlds' <a href="https://www.procedural-worlds.com/products/professional/sectr/">SECTR</a> level streaming system to support loading world chunks concurrently in multiplayer.

                      Implemented a component-based script design that made picking up and using any prop possible. From a wooden chair to a machine gun, each item had its own unique attributes, uses, and effects on the world.
